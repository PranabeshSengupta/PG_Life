# PG_Life
The PG_Life Web Application is a dynamic, full-stack platform developed to help users find the best Paying Guest (PG) accommodations in selected locations. Built during my internship at Internshala, this project aimed to provide an easy-to-use interface for users to search, filter, and explore PG options tailored to their needs.
